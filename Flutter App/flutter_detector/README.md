# Flutter TFLite Detector application

Flutter application with possible way of TFLite models usage on heavy camera streams

## Nice stuff used
- BLoC architecture - nice event driven pattern
- TFLite with custom models
- EXIF for proper image rotation
- Camera - for image stream, but while it is really heavy for processing - frame picking approach used
